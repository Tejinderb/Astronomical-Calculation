I have done many changes in Swiss Ephemeris library for precise astronomical calculations. I applied the approach on by refining the algo like Julian Day and sidereal time calculations and i have added some input validation for dates, coordinates and bodies to prevent the error and handles edge cases. Also made some valid comments in the code so that its easy to understand at a professional level and also to maintain it easily. So my correction are there displayed in the photos i attached . I also do things in Reactjs, Next js applications.
